# *Popillia japonica*
*Popillia japonica*, commonly known as the Japanese beetle, is an invasive scarab beetle native to East Asia but now widespread in North America and parts of Europe. It is a highly destructive pest, feeding on the leaves, flowers, and fruits of over 300 plant species, including many economically important crops.

Understanding its population genomics is crucial for uncovering patterns of invasion, gene flow, and local adaptation. This knowledge can inform the development of targeted and sustainable management strategies, including potential genetic control methods.
