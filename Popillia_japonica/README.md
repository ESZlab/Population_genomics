# *Popillia japonica*
*Popillia japonica*, commonly known as the Japanese beetle, is an invasive scarab beetle native to East Asia but now widespread in North America and parts of Europe. It is a highly destructive pest, feeding on the leaves, flowers, and fruits of over 400 plant species, including many economically important crops.

Understanding its population genomics is crucial for uncovering patterns of invasion, gene flow, and local adaptation. This knowledge can inform the development of targeted and sustainable management strategies, including potential genetic control methods.

This section includes the procedures and scripts used in the paper ‘Whole genome resequencing reveals origins and global invasion pathways of the Japanese beetle *Popillia japonica*’ by Rebecca Funari *et al.*, currently under revision in Molecular Ecology
